Putting together a script to just simply loop through all of these materials and run on the cluster.
Actually, there is no looping. Really, this script is just a wrapper that imports the proper
functions for specifying simulation parameters and calls solveADMM.semiParallel with the
appropriate arguments.

import solveADMM
import sys
import doFolders
import importlib

# trialNs = 100

def main():
    ''' simple main routine '''
    prSpec = importlib.import_module('expts.' + sys.argv[1])

    prSpec.D['outDir'] = doFolders.ensureFolders(prSpec.D, int(sys.argv[2]))
    
    
    gogo = prSpec.getMyVars(int(sys.argv[2]), prSpec.D)
    gogo['ix'] = int(sys.argv[2])    
    solveADMM.semiParallel(**gogo)
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
