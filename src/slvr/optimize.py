abstract definition for specifying any given optimization object.
Not a formal requirement, since Python can be pretty loose with

import forward.flat

class optimizer(object):
    '''base class for optimization routines'''
    
    def __init__(self,freq,incAng,flavor):
        self.fwd = forward.flat.makeMeA(flavor, freq, incAng)
